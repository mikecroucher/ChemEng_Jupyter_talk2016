These are the slides for a presentation I gave to Sheffield University's Department of Physics called **Jupyter notebook for teaching physics**. The event was their teaching away day in December 2015

The latest version of the presentation can be viewed by going to http://mikecroucher.github.io/Jupyter-for-Physics

The presentation uses Reveal.js and the source is available on the gh-pages branch of this repository.
