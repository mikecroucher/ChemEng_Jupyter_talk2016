These are the slides for a presentation I gave to Sheffield University's Department of Chemical Engineering. The event was their teaching away day in April 2016 and my presentation was for 10 minutes.

The latest version of the presentation can be viewed by going to http://mikecroucher.github.io/ChemEng_Jupyter_talk2016

The presentation uses Reveal.js and the source is available on the gh-pages branch of this repository.
